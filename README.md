❤️ Heart Disease Predictor

A machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in an individual using various medical attributes. Built and trained entirely in Google Colab.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Takes medical input from users (like age, cholesterol, etc.)
- Predicts heart disease using a trained Logistic Regression model
- Visualizes and explains predictions (with Grok)
- Offers an interactive Streamlit interface
- 
## 💡 Tech Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data handling
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for ML model
- **Pickle** for saving model and scaler
- **Streamlit** to create the web app
- **Grok** for model interpretation (optional)
